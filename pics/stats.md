- 270 photos on my new phone backed up to icloud equals 1GB
- iCloud photos is 21%
- in other words to get to 5GB which is the maximum on the free plan I should
be able to store around 1250 photos to 1350 photos.
- after 4 weeks in Mexico the total number of photos taken is 270
- so if I take 270 photos in the next 4 weeks we should be good to go
for the rest of the trip
- and this just the photos stored on iCloud
- many more photos have been taken and stored in the other respective places
