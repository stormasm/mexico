### Checking Bags

- if I fly aeromexico from another mexico city other than mexico city do I have to get my bags prior to flying internationally ?

- If you are flying Aeromexico on a single ticket from a Mexican city (e.g., Guadalajara, Cancun) through Mexico City (MEX) to an international destination, you generally do not need to collect your bags in Mexico City. Your luggage will be checked through to your final international destination.

### Key Details for Connecting in Mexico City (MEX):

- Luggage: Your bags are checked directly to the international destination.
- Customs/Immigration: You will pass through Mexican immigration at MEX, but not customs, as that occurs at your final destination.
- Exceptions: If your flights were booked as separate tickets, you will likely need to collect your bags and re-check them.
- Recommendation: Always confirm at your initial check-in counter that your bags are tagged to the final international destination.
- For most, you can walk directly to your departing gate for the international flight.
