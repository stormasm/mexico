### Rodin's Gates of Hell

The Gates of Hell sculpture in the Soumaya Museum in Mexico City is made of bronze with a golden platinum surface.

Explanation

The Gates of Hell is a monumental sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin that depicts a scene from Dante's Divine Comedy. The sculpture is made of bronze and is 6 meters high, 4 meters wide, and 1 meter deep. It contains 180 figures that range in size from 6 inches to over 3 feet.

The Soumaya Museum in Mexico City houses the most important collection of Rodin's work outside of France. The museum's collection includes works of mythological inspiration, portraits, and body fragmentation.
Rodin was a neoclassical sculptor who revolutionized the genre. He was trained as a modeler and created his work first in clay. His bronzes were cast through the lost wax casting process.
