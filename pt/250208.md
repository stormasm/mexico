We left our house on Wednesday January 08 at around 8:30am when a nice lady
who was a grandma picked us up at our humble abode in Corvallis and drove
us to the Eugene airport.  We got there about 9:30am and our plane left
at 2:30pm.  So we had a nice long wait at the airport contemplating until
our plane went bye bye for Las Vegas.  Our first night there we shared a nice
meal with Al who was from the Philippines and the rest is history.

We had a nice desayuno buffet for the 2nd Saturday in a row at the same place
where I had some nice food and a bunch of cold sugar cereal with yogurt and
caramel sauce.  We were happy lunch eaters but I think we are good with that
place for awhile. Along our journey today we saw many amazing places including
a bar we stopped by where Hb and I used the restroom.  The saloon had some
great food and maybe we will be able to find it again in the future but
I highly doubt it.
