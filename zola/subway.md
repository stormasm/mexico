## The Mexico City Subway

Each time we ride the subway on this journey I will document it here.

### Stops upon which we entered the subway system

#### 1. Popotla

This was our first subway ride and we got on after having a really nice lunch at
[Chon y Chano](https://www.facebook.com/chonychanooficial/?locale=es_LA).
Earlier we did our first walk into Santa Maria La Ribera and then walked to the
corner of Avenida Ricardo Flores Magon y Cedro.  We then walked west a bit
and made a turn on Calle Plan de Ayala and then we took a picture of Michele
in front of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional.  

#### 2. Merced

We did our big walk today down to the Zocalo.

Its 5.4km from our house to the Merced subway stop on Line 1.
We pretty much walked all the way down Paseo de la Reforma and then
made a right turn on Avenida Juarez which is pretty much where Alameda
Central park begins.  We then walked to the Zocalo and over to the Mercado
Merced.

#### 3. Polanco

Its 5km from our house to the Museo Soumaya.

We went to the Museo Soumayo today.  We walked all the way to the museum
and then took the subway back home.  Upon exiting the subway station we
had a delicious dinner on the street at a super fantastic gordito stand
which we will never forget.  It is called Sevilla Gordito and is located
just as you enter or exit our subway stop.
