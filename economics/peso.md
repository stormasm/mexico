### Peso Dollar Relationship 2026

The Mexican Peso is strengthening against the U.S. Dollar due to high interest rate differentials (Mexico's central bank keeping rates higher), strong foreign investment (especially nearshoring/FDI), booming tourism, a weaker dollar amid potential Fed cuts, and Mexico's robust trade with the U.S., all boosting demand for pesos and stability.

#### Key Drivers for Peso Strength

Interest Rate Differential: Mexico's central bank (Banxico) has maintained higher rates than the U.S. Federal Reserve, making peso-denominated assets more attractive for investors seeking higher returns (carry trade).

Nearshoring & FDI: Global companies are shifting manufacturing to Mexico (nearshoring), increasing demand for pesos to fund investments and operations.

Strong Trade with U.S.: A booming U.S. economy increases demand for Mexican goods, bringing more dollars into Mexico and strengthening the peso.

Booming Tourism: Record levels of international visitors and tourism spending bring significant foreign currency into Mexico, bolstering the peso.

U.S. Dollar Weakness: Expectations of future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weaken the dollar, making the peso more competitive.

Macroeconomic Stability: Perceived stability and effective economic management in Mexico increase investor confidence.

#### Supporting Factors

Oil Prices: As a major oil producer, higher oil prices can bring more dollars into Mexico, supporting the currency.

Managed Exchange Rate: A floating peso with few capital controls has historically allowed it to appreciate during periods of strong fundamentals.
