After living in Mexico City for 3 months I feel like I know the energy of
the city well enough to reflect on my observations of what daily life is
like here.  This is our second year here here and each time we spent
6 weeks here totalling 12 weeks.  We were in Ecuador for 3 months as well
but living in different places along the way we were not in one place long
enough to get a sense of one place.

Pictures and words can never truly capture what its like to be somewhere
however it helps to understand a place better with some insight from different
people.
