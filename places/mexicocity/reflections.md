After living in Mexico City for 3 months I feel like I know the energy of
the city well enough to reflect on my observations of what daily life is
like here.  This is our second year here and each time we spent
6 weeks here totalling 12 weeks.  We were in Ecuador for 3 months as well
but living in different places along the way we were not in one place long
enough to get a sense of one place.

Pictures and words can never truly capture what its like to be somewhere
however it helps to understand a place better with some insight from different
people.

#### Climate

We live in Oregon where the winter time weather is not great.  Everyone reacts
differently to certain climates and for me being in Corvallis in the winter
is too much because the house we live in does not have the correct setup for
heating.  More on this topic at another place in time but when we arrive in
Mexico City each year I breathe a huge sigh of relief to know that for the
time that we are here I do not need to worry about hats, scarfs and gloves
on a daily basis not to mention the rain and dampness which goes straight
to my bone.

Mexico City sits at 7350 feet or 2240 meters.  Its latitude is 19.40
For reference the tropic of cancer sits at around 23.26 and Hawaii and
Mexico City share simlar coordinates.

Meaning starting at around early February the temps head up into the high 70's
to low 80's and stay there into the spring and summer when the rainy season
kicks in through November.  The nights are cool because of the high elevation
and the air is very dry similar to other spots on Planet Earth at high elevations.
For Michele and I we prefer this type of climate after living at similar
elevations in New Mexico.

#### Flora y Fauna

Mexico City is green, especially the parts of the city where we spend our
time. It seems that the city streets are continually and methodically maintained
by a very large dedicated crew of people who are always out there in the streets
maintaining the landscaping and the health of the trees which can get to be very
big and tall.  I have taken quite a few pictures of the monster trees of Cdmx.

The most iconic and popular tree in Mexico City is the Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), renowned for painting the city in shades of lilac and purple, particularly during spring (March-April).

Other commonly found and significant trees include the Shamel Ash (Fraxinus uhdei), Glossy Privet (Ligustrum lucidum), and American Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua).

Key Trees in Mexico City:

- Jacarandas: Non-native but iconic, these trees, introduced in the early 20th century, thrive in the city's climate, blooming along major avenues like Paseo de la Reforma and in neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa.
- Shamel Ash (Fresno): A dominant, native species frequently found on city streets.
- Glossy Privet (Trueno): A common, hardy tree used for urban landscaping.
- American Sweetgum (Liquidámbar): Widely planted, especially in residential areas.
- Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina): A very common, non-native street tree.
- Montezuma Bald Cypress (Ahuehuete): An important native species, historically significant, found in locations like Bosque de Chapultepec.

These trees contribute to the green and in the case of the Jacaranda vibrant landscape of Mexico City, serving as important urban green spaces and landmarks.
