## Reflections on Mexico City

After living in Mexico City for 3 months I feel like I know the energy of
the city well enough to reflect on my observations of what daily life is
like here.  This is our second year here and each time we spent
6 weeks here totalling 12 weeks.  We were in Ecuador for 3 months as well
but living in different places along the way we were not in one place long
enough to get a sense of one place.

Pictures and words can never truly capture what its like to be somewhere
however it helps to understand a place better with some insight from different
people.

#### Climate

We live in Oregon where the winter time weather is not great.  Everyone reacts
differently to certain climates and for me being in Corvallis in the winter
is too much because the house we live in does not have the correct setup for
heating.  More on this topic at another place in time but when we arrive in
Mexico City each year I breathe a huge sigh of relief to know that for the
time that we are here I do not need to worry about hats, scarfs and gloves
on a daily basis not to mention the rain and dampness which goes straight
to my bone.

Mexico City sits at 7350 feet or 2240 meters.  Its latitude is 19.40
For reference the tropic of cancer sits at around 23.26 and Hawaii and
Mexico City share simlar coordinates.

Meaning starting at around early February the temps head up into the high 70's
to low 80's and stay there into the spring and summer when the rainy season
kicks in through November.  The nights are cool because of the high elevation
and the air is very dry similar to other spots on Planet Earth at high elevations.
For Michele and I we prefer this type of climate after living at similar
elevations in New Mexico.

#### Flora y Fauna

Mexico City is green, especially the parts of the city where we spend our
time. It seems that the city streets are continually and methodically maintained
by a very large dedicated crew of people who are always out there in the streets
maintaining the landscaping and the health of the trees which can get to be very
big and tall.  I have taken quite a few pictures of the monster trees of Cdmx.

The most iconic and popular tree in Mexico City is the Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), renowned for painting the city in shades of lilac and purple, particularly during spring (March-April).

Other commonly found and significant trees include the Shamel Ash (Fraxinus uhdei), Glossy Privet (Ligustrum lucidum), and American Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua).

Key Trees in Mexico City:

- Jacarandas: Non-native but iconic, these trees, introduced in the early 20th century, thrive in the city's climate, blooming along major avenues like Paseo de la Reforma and in neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa.
- Shamel Ash (Fresno): A dominant, native species frequently found on city streets.
- Glossy Privet (Trueno): A common, hardy tree used for urban landscaping.
- American Sweetgum (Liquidámbar): Widely planted, especially in residential areas.
- Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina): A very common, non-native street tree.
- Montezuma Bald Cypress (Ahuehuete): An important native species, historically significant, found in locations like Bosque de Chapultepec.

These trees contribute to the green and in the case of the Jacaranda vibrant landscape of Mexico City, serving as important urban green spaces and landmarks.

#### Food

When you think of Mexico City the first thing that comes into everyones mind is food.
That is because when you have over 20 million people living in one valley surrounded
by big mountains everyone needs to eat.  And the place to eat the food is on the street.
That is where the food mainly gets eaten.  The number of street taco stands in certain
parts of the city is amazing.  You would think how many street taco stands can actually
survive and do well but the answer is `a whole lot` !  It is astounding to me purely from
an economic point of view how all of these places can support themselves with a customer
base that makes their business worthwhile.  But clearly it must work.

#### People and Prosperity

As a country Mexico is doing very well.  Any economic study, youtube video you
watch or just look at the economic numbers and you will see that not only is
Mexico thriving but it is firing on all cylinders.  This has been happening for
quite some time but in the past few years it has started to accelerate.  There
are many reasons for this but basically it boils down to the prosperity mindset
of the people along with amazing leadership at the top of the country.

The energy of the country and the people is successful.  In Mexico City all you
have to do is look around and see that people are hard working.  The number
of people on the street simply shining shoes is impressive.  And the people of
Mexico also support each other in many different ways.  From the blind person
on the subway walking along each car selling little candy bars to the street
taco people each day packing up their carts, washing down the streets where
the taco stands were for the day and hauling them away each night only to start
the same process over again the next day.

You wonder where did that big taco stand go that was sitting there during the
day and it is totally gone.  Not only is it gone but the street is wet and
the sidewalk is cleaner than it was in the morning before they arrived.

#### Density

This is subject that is overwhelming.  One can not even begin to understand
what it means to live in a fairly small area with so many people. For people
from the Willamette Valley reading this post Mexico City is about the size
of Albany to Corvallis to Lebanon filled in with 20 million people.

The population density of Mexico City proper (16 boroughs) is approximately 6,163 to 6,200 inhabitants per square kilometer (roughly 16,000 per square mile) as of 2020-2022 data.

The city covers a land area of about 1,485 to 1,495 square kilometers with a population of over 9.2 million. 

Key Density Details: 

- Mexico City Proper: ~6,163-6,202 residents per \(\text{km}^{2}\).
- Urban Area/Metropolitan (2025): The urban area, which includes surrounding suburbs, has a higher density of approximately 8,457 per \(\text{km}^{2}\).
- Density Trends: The city density has increased from 5,718 in 2005 to over 6,160 in 2020. 

Metro Population: The Greater Mexico City metropolitan area (including surrounding municipalities) holds over 21-23 million people, making it one of the largest and most densely populated metropolitan areas in the Western Hemisphere.
