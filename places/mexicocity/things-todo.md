- The hub for contemporary art in CDMX, I would say is the MUAC at the university (UNAM). And a great museum whose building is an amazing feature is Museo Anahuacall
- If you are into art museums and you didn't go to the MUAC (Museum of Contemporary Art) in the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) you lost the best one. It has the best temporary expositions and the building is simply amazing. Also, the surroundings, are incredible... Contemporary buildings built on a sea of dry lava rocks...
