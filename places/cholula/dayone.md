The bus ride from Mexico City to Puebla was interesting.

A friend of mine told me that he did a ride from Cuernavaca
to Mexico City and that you go up a very big mountain and then
back down.

The same is true driving from Cdmx to Puebla.

Point one is that last year we left Mexico City and were on our
way to Querétaro and it took about two hours to escape / leave
Mexico City.

Puebla was not quite as bad but close.  It took us about 90
minutes or so to finally leave Cdmx.  The traffic there is
incredible and we have only seen it twice in our life.

Last year and this year :)

Once you finally leave Mexico City you start climbing up a very
big mountain which takes a very long time to summit.  As you start
the climb Mexico City fades into the background and if you look
behind you as you are climbing up you can see the city in the distance
and the hazy air that is part of living in Cdmx.

After cresting the mountain and starting down the other side the
air starts to clear some and on the right side you will see a rather
large mountain loom in the distance.

We landed in Puebla at Paseo Destino and then caught an Uber
over to Cholula.  It was a quick ride and we took some back
roads which went just south of Universidad de las Américas Puebla.

The weather here is beautiful.  Its in the low 80's and slightly
hot just the way we like it.  The walking strategy is always to
be on the shaded side of the street which means you are continually
switching back and forth as you navigate the streets of Cholula in
the middle of the day.

The place where we are staying is nice.  Its close to everything
yet in about 20 minutes or so walking you can be on the edge and
mostly out of town.

This is very cool for us as we can see what the "country life" in
Mexico starts to look like.  To put it mildly being in Mexico
especially in the country side is kind of "rough" because we
are not familiar with it mainly.

A friend of mine said to me that if you have seen one Latin American
city you have seen them all and for people who have done extensive
traveling in Latin America this could not be more true.

The thing I like about Cholula is that its on the edge of one
of the largest cities in Mexico.  When I say large cities there
are two classes of large cities.  There is Mexico City and
then there is everyone else.

And everywhere else is fairly similar once you hit a certain population
size.  We got the edge of town, found a nice pasteleria and ate some
cookies and then kept going.

For Michele and I life in Mexico is all about the food, the people,
the language and the beautiful climate at around the same elevation
of another place we have lived which is Santa Fe, New Mexico.

On the topic of food one of our core staples is
[chilaquiles](https://www.google.com/search?q=chilaquiles&sca_esv=4585a0b0b6a9671b&sxsrf=ANbL-n6FPY1898mHxv4ripDfLmxYu7qK8A:1771640583199&source=hp&biw=1470&bih=798&ei=BxeZaeChCvW6kPIP_cGSgA0&iflsig=AFdpzrgAAAAAaZklFzKWjHcNHDtFsjK-uCqf71jd9ibv&ved=0ahUKEwigwYS9w-mSAxV1HUQIHf2gBNAQ4dUDCBc&uact=5&oq=chilaquiles&gs_lp=EgNpbWciC2NoaWxhcXVpbGVzMggQABiABBixAzIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjWElAAWLIQcAB4AJABAJgBqQGgAbcMqgEEMC4xMbgBA8gBAPgBAYoCC2d3cy13aXotaW1nmAILoALuDMICBxAjGCcYyQLCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFmAMAkgcEMC4xMaAHhjqyBwQwLjExuAfuDMIHBzAuMi44LjHIByaACAA&sclient=img&udm=2)

If we have good chilaquiles place to eat no matter where we are in Mexico
we are very happy.  And on our first day of being here we hit a homerun
and just happened to find a great place.  We know good chilaquiles because
we have eaten a lot of these dishes and we know the best places where we
have gone and the list is very clear in our hungry minds.

There are some other mission critical things that are very helpful as
we travel across Mexico and that is that our place is close to a store
that sells 10 liters of water.  Unfortunately water in Mexico is not
potable and so you need to haul your water wherever you are.  Luckily
the 10 liter bottles are just barely manageable especially for pouring
the water into smaller water bottles :)

We also found a nice place to get our
[arroz con leche](https://www.google.com/search?q=arroz+con+leche&sca_esv=4585a0b0b6a9671b&biw=1176&bih=638&udm=2&sxsrf=ANbL-n4V-ypEbs-XGf_vcOo_0bHood8rLQ%3A1771640587329&ei=CxeZaajpE9TBkPIPyOex6Ak&oq=arroz+&gs_lp=Egtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZyIGYXJyb3ogKgIIADIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDMggQABiABBixAzIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDMggQABiABBixAzIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDMggQABiABBixAzIIEAAYgAQYsQNInSlQ7QFY1x1wAngAkAEBmAHNAaAB-xKqAQYwLjE1LjG4AQHIAQD4AQGYAgmgAtIIqAIKwgINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBcICBhAAGAcYHsICBxAjGCcYyQLCAgUQABiABMICChAjGCcYyQIY6gLCAgoQABiABBhDGIoFwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigWYAwaIBgGSBwMyLjegB9hgsgcDMC43uAfCCMIHAzItOcgHMIAIAA&sclient=gws-wiz-img) which is one of my favorite dessert items as I am not
lucky enough like Michele to be able to eat all of the good cookies
here too. Although today I snuck a few good cookies and luckily was not
too badly affected by them.

At the end of the day otherwise known as `atardecer` we got to the
[largest known pyramid in the world today](https://yucatanmagazine.com/the-grand-city-of-cholula-and-its-sacred-pyramid-the-largest-in-the-word/) which is about a five minute walk from our bed
and breakfast.
